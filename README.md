# Noisy Neighbour

Neighbour moved in and listened to max volume all night to
podcasts about spirituality, global warming
and self care while pumping weights.

A "best of" here: https://youtu.be/hyjDLyST_qQ

Then the police confiscated his TV & stereo. 

Without a TV & stereo he resorted terrorising the house by dropping
exercise weights which can even be felt on the street.

I started measuring the noise levels in my flat 1/1 with a zoom H4 ambient sound
recorder and wrote a python script detecting the "thuds". Sensitivity at the zoom set to "high" (=night time).

Every peak represents an exercise weight hitting the floor in flat 0/1 below.

## Sound levels from 4:38am *after* the police visited him

*Constantly* throwing exercise weights on the floor with
much higher intensity so that the recorder went *off scale* (=1).

# 6th July

It was all quiet till exactly 2:30am in the morning and then the
weights started hitting the ground (continues longer than the 1 1/2
hrs but can't be bothered to add the other files).

# 7th July

Probably so far the most disturbing night: 1st some constant hammering while he
was walking throught the flat, then loads of thuds with heavy weights hitting
the floor and then again constant hammering while walking around (even to the main door).

![alt tag](Loudness_-_7_July_from_0_11.png)

## Constant hammering sounds at 3:15am & 4:25am

Loads of "thuds" (with a hammer???) every few seconds around 3:15am
and 4:25am.

[4:25am: MP3 / Sound recording with the hammer-sounds where he walks
through the flat while hammering walls/floor,
then goes to the main door and hammers
against that so that the whole close echoes the hammering sound (at 4:25 into the recording) and
then goes back into the flat continues hammering.](<./flat11-7juj_4_25am.mp3>).

![alt tag](Loudness_-_Fri_Jul__8_00_40_00_2022.png)

Massive bang right at the start of the night which went off scale
but at that time I was still working. Then the "usual"
thuds from 3:20am in the morning.

Quality time away catching up on sleep

# 18 July 2022

Back in Glasgow.

From 4am he did some DIY with a hammer: [a couple of audio clips](<./nn18jul.mp4>)

The weight-dropping started at about 6:30am (but had to swap battery so missed the start).

# 19 July

All quiet. I guess pumping weights during the heatwave even at 4am is too much.

# 20 July

Exercise weights started hitting the floor at 5:28am with first
quick banging (against a wall?) and then something heavy dropping on the floor.

Then that's repeated 10 times till 6am.

[Example MP3 of one of these slowly building up thuds till the final massive bang](<./STE-20Jul_sample_thud.mp3>) -- Listen with headphones as it sounds like a basedrum being kicked.

# 21 July

Thuds spaced perfectly over the entire night. Every single one woke me up.

## Sound files

Original recordings were at 44kHz sampling rate.

To be able to load the 6hr WAV into python it was downsampled to
500Hz sampling rate to focus on the low base frequencies or "thuds".
For example:

```
sox STE-038_2_27_5jul.wav -c 1 -r 500 STE-038_2_27_5jul_500Hz.wav
```
